# workday-planner

For this task I was asked to create a planner that changed colors consistent with time blocks that are in the past, present, and future.
I adjusted some color content tto make it a bit more pleasant but this app is linked to dayjs time formats so if you are viewing this during the hours of 5:01 pm to 8:59 pm you will most likely experiece a pale blue hue to all time blocks on this planner.  Once you are in the window of 9 am to 5 pm if the time block hour is still ahead it will appear green while if you are in a current hour it will show as red while the hours of the past will have the previously stated pale blue hue.  Attached are a couple screen shots taken as I tested the data storage accuracy and the time slots correctly adjusting through the day.  I look forward to any feedback over this particuar project.
